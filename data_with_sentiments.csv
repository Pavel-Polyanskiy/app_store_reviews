0,coinbase-buy-bitcoin-ether,Richieüóû,2022-08-23 07:41:37,"Coinbase is unarguably the most reliable cryptocurrency app but there might be some other things needed such as efficient and reliable ways to recover lost or stolen crypto just the way I was able to get back all I lost. The significance of stable coins such as bitcoins, ethereum and the rest in the crypto currency's market cannot be overemphasized as they contribute to the regulation of the market which makes investors trade these coins more often. In the course of trying to stay relevant in the market, different unforeseen circumstances can lead to serious issues or concerns because anyone can make mistakes. When I lost a whole lot of my bitcoins to unsuspected spammers, I was broken and determined to look for a way out to recover my money at all costs. It's wasn't easy finding a genuine tech pundit that could get the job done perfectly so I guess I was very lucky to get in contact with professionally skilled cyber security team of cryptoregain @ g mail ,com,which was referred by a blockchain expert. Without having to say much, they are the real deal you can trust to recover whatever you lost. They retrieved all my lost coins surprisingly because I almost lost hope before contacting cryptoregain. More services they offer include bitcoins mining investment for very lucrative returns from their cloud. You can get in touch with them for what you need and definitely appreciate me later for the tip.",5,app_store,en,0.24201388888888895,0.8463

I love everything about Coinbase and what it stands for.. However, you all are making it hard for me.. To compete against Robinhood, Cashapp, Tdameritrade, and soon to be Fidelity; please find a way to get rid of these fees to buy into the market.. Maybe keep the selling or converting fees.. But, we need more people in the market and the fees are not helping.. Please go public soon.. Merge with Square or buy them if possible.. Or, merge with Facebook as that would allow Basebook to be an industry leader in crypto and p2p transfers and transactions... Most important, I Bcurrently use yahoo finance to manage and see my average cost and gains or losses for all my different crypto investments.. I would love if Coinbase would incorporate my average cost per coin.. Also, add in my daily and total gains and losses.. I should not have to use a third party site to manage investments that I purchased on your site.. Lastly, please add custom alerts for all of the crypto‚Äôs offered on the platform... We only have the ability right now to set custom alerts for three assets and again I have to use a third party site for the others..

While curious about prices in the market for today I tapped on the the ‚ÄòTrade‚Äô tab. Following the tapping of this tab I was lead to a new interface. Something I had never seen before. Two new categories: Watchlist and New on Coinbase. The Watchlist category provided, well the assets on your watchlist and the New on Coinbase provided all assets that had been recently added to the platform. Along with these updates came some tweaks to the ‚ÄòGainers‚Äô and ‚ÄòLosers‚Äô categories, which were now in order from Greatest to Least, compared to being all out of order previously. After examining the new Update I delivered a message with screenshots attached to my trading colleague ‚ÄòWallstreetJared‚Äô to alert him of the news.

Some cryptos like DOGE and XLM trade in hundredths of pennies (IE .2577) so it would be nice to see the exact amount listed on the orders. I may have a few orders placed in the .25 range, so it‚Äôs difficult to find a specific order in that range when they all just say .25. I would assume this has to be a pretty easy fix.
I also have another suggestion that would be helpful to me and I‚Äôm sure to others‚Ä¶ It would be a VERY nice feature to be able to set up price alert pushes or at the very least to receive a push notification when one of our orders is filled.
I would definitely give this app 5-stars if the above suggestions were implemented. In fact, I would even pay a subscription fee to be able to have push notifications. I‚Äôm not sure if there is a fee for Coinbase to send out push notifications, but if there is a fee, it can‚Äôt be much as I can get multiple push notifications on the scores of my favorite teams (or even the entire NFL slate of games) from free sports apps.",4,app_store,en,0.17839080459770115,0.9928

There is endless amounts of information about cryptocurrency on Coinbase and if it is t there u can be connected to it.  I had been weary about crypto but when I heard about Coinbase I was originally in getting shares of it when it went public.  When I was unable to get the stock and it went through the roof right off like had figured we‚Äôll that is when I decided to download and check it out.  Coinbase gave me a small amount for down loading the app and then through the learn and earn feature I was able to learn what crypto is and does but also get like four different currencies.  The ease of operation of the app made it very i intimidating and I continued to learn about crypto amd now I‚Äôm trading almost daily.  I also had some support issues with my Coinbase card and they were quickly replied to and I was given some basic help which was unable to solve the problem but they sent my issue up the support chain and my Coinbase card was fully operational the next morning.

I‚Äôm in the process of switching to the another platform since Coinbase fees are through the roof, and I feel like they have their hands in every single thing I do; I‚Äôm almost afraid to even open the app in fear they may tack on nother fee. The costs are not small either; buying a small number of coins that are well under a dollar without staking options, the fee‚Äôs are more than quadruple the cost of the coin, then another fee when you sell any portion of it.

They show you the list price, but when you review your purchase before submitting it, they actually charge you a higher price/coin on top of their transaction fee. It‚Äôs the same thing with selling. They give you a lower rate than the listed price, as well as charging you transaction fees. They‚Äôre scalping customers, exactly the same way RH does by giving you, ‚Äúthe customer‚Äù a .03 cent spread. Even with the ‚ÄúCoinbase One‚Äù membership, this is still true.

If you can learn more complicated methods of trading crypto, I suggest that over this. If not, I hope you don‚Äôt mind getting scalped.

I later found a notification in my account that I owed them like $100? Weird but okay fine, I paid it.

Coinbase, unlike other apps, charges a high fee for clients to store and secure funds in Coinbase crypto wallets. You'll also pay a market buy/sell price that's substantially more than the actual price of the coin you're buying. For example, if you buy a $1000 coin with $1000 in cash, you will receive about $900 of the coin you just bought. Coinbase charges you a high fee for holding and securing your cryptocurrency once you're ready to sell (regardless if it was for a minute or a year). Furthermore, you will receive a market buy/sell price that is far lower than the actual price of the coin you are selling. For example, if you sell the same crypto you just bought for $1000 and only got $900 in crypto, you'll earn roughly $800 in fiat. This is robbery in broad daylight, in my opinion. 

When you trade or exchange Cryptos with other Cryptos, it gets even worse. Because there is no easy way to contact these crooks, their customer service is non-existent.

This is an easy way to get into the cryptocurrency, but for the uninitiated it is not a trading platform. GDAX is. You can fund your COINBASE account, but they neglect to tell you that you can make a GDAX account and transfer your money free of charge and buy/sell/trade for minimum fees. Limit buys and sells are free on GDAX. The pros: COINBASE is legit and GDAX is legit. They are FDIC protected and your legal tender is insured by the federal government because it‚Äôs held in an escrow account in a bank. Your coins are insured by insurance policies. BUT It would be nice to be informed ahead of time that you can incur substantially higher fees using the simplified ap and that if your going to be trading short or long term, that transferring your funds to GDAX (an actual exchange) results in much lower fees and free limit orders.

Even though im not planning on selling anytime soon, it shouldnt take so long for my purchases to be approved and show up in my wallet or portfolio. Also, they recommend using or linking your bank account, instead of using your debit card which is immediate and doesnt take 4-7 days to clear. Why does it take so long to clear? 
I understand that they want to make sure funds are in your account (i assume), but 4-7 days, is way too long. I dont think i can sell anything until everything has cleared. I also noticed that the $ was already taken out of my bank account- so why are they not available as soon as you have taken the money out of my account?

52,coinbase-buy-bitcoin-ether,Philosopherwarrior,2020-11-25 01:05:04,"If you want to get into crypto, you may want/have to start here, unfortunately. The crypto market is still the wild west and very difficult to figure out for the average investor.

The good: it‚Äôs safe as far as I know and I‚Äôve never had an issue with missing coins.

The bad: most of it. 
1. The transactions are very expensive. You pay high fees to purchase coins and you also pay to take your money out.

2. Annoyingly, Coinbase does not give you an average price of your purchases. Meaning, when you buy a coin at different prices the app doesn‚Äôt calculate how much you‚Äôve paid overall. If you‚Äôre buying coins over time at say $2-$5 it is up to you to sort of figure out what your baseline is, since the coin prices are constantly changing you don‚Äôt know when you could sell at a loss or at a profit. This is such a basic feature it‚Äôs mind boggling they refuse to adopt it. Robinhood has this on every purchase you make.

3. You can set up automatic payments to buy coins from the app but to stop them you have to do it through the website. This is meant to be inconvenient on purpose. 

CB adopts coins after they have ‚Äúpopped‚Äù (you miss the initial earnings) but there might be a legitimate reason for these delays so I won‚Äôt ding them on this.

Coinbase is begging for a rival app to take over. RH is a great app but they don‚Äôt seem interested in expanding their crypto coin offers. Etoro might prove to be a better app.",5,app_store,en,-0.018846153846153832,0.7918

I disputed the charge with my bank and Coinbase and was refunded the extra transfer amount. However, a few days later Coinbase sent me an email stating they were going to collect the debt to them in 15 days from my current balance (coins I had previously purchased). So I emailed them literally 7 times and opened cases which were never resolved and they didn‚Äôt help me but they still closed each case stating the issue was resolved.

They literally stole my money. I am reporting them to the better business bureau and their customer support is non existent so please refrain from using this platform.

Gives easy access to cryptocurrency trading. 
‚ÄúInstant‚Äù deposits. (More on this below.)
App is user friendly and simple. 

CONS:
Gives easy access to cryptocurrency trading. 
Instant deposits allow purchases, positive cash flow is needed for high frequency trading. (Duh)
App is way too simple. Even Pro is too limited. We need far more functionality and features. Tracking data of trades etc etc. Charts need improvement. Other Apps should not rival a Billion dollar company in tracking cryptocurrency. You need better CS. Use TDA as your model, not RbnHd.
It should be more clear when funds have cleared the bank, and when cryptocurrency becomes transferable. The Portfolio should only have assets managed in list form. A ‚ÄùCoin List‚Äù can show all coins available, tradable, etc, and a Watchlist are in dire need of inclusion. I also don‚Äôt understand the multiple app approach. Account privilege status should be set up in an account hierarchy that grants access to higher levels within the App, not split up into separate Apps. 

Over all great experience so far. Reliable yet limited, but does what it does well. Let your deposits clear before you transfer coin. Know the limitations and pray for updates.

This exposes end users to the potential loss of their crypto-currencies, while believing they are ""secure"". As a better form of security, Coinbase should add support for both hardware (yubikey etc.) and software authenticator apps to better secure users' crypto assets. In the meantime, users should use all, or a combination of the following: Use a UNIQUE/strong password for this application (ideally generated by a password manager) that is used nowhere else.

Right away I began trading and everything was very easy to navigate. The platform is visually pleasing, easy to use and get started, and also offers a wide selection of coins to trade from. 

My only complaint is that there is no (easy) way to see how much I‚Äôve gained or lost since the time of purchase. What I mean by this is that on other trading apps when you buy a coin/stock you are able to immediately see how much the value has increased or decreased which gives you a good indication of when to sell and how to track gains and losses. 

Unless I am mistaken, the Coinbase app doesn‚Äôt offer this feature. You can see the current price of the asset and how much it has gone up within a specific time frame and your current balance in local currency as well as the conversion amount (e.g. 
         $512
          0.01 BTC
)

I would really like to see Coinbase add another drop down option on the ‚ÄúYour Assets‚Äù page that shows exactly how much the value of each asset has changed since the original purchase as well as its current value. 

(E.g.
 
Bitcoin           $50,000   <‚Äî current price
                     +$1,000     <‚Äî change in value since time of purchase

They shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to do business if they cannot help their customers. So then 2 of my purchases went through as I was able to fix things on my end . Well those purchases where then stolen from my account by Coinbase and I have not received a refund or any support as to what is happening. My free crypto that I earned was also taken from my account . I doubt I will ever be able to get any help from Coinbase .

If I make a trade then look at the price per coin over the next few hours after that purchase, it fluctuates. Eventually, coinbase give you the worst possible price over hours and pockets the difference.

For example, CRO was .1210 when I tried to buy, and after doing the math (which is not provided because they know it‚Äôs shady) my average cost was somewhere around .125. Not a huge difference but that is hard earned profit by this point.

When signing up, I was asked for my nationality. I entered it and followed their requested steps. The next day, it asked me to resubmit my documents, so I did. After again being asked to resubmit, I reached out to support who told me to check my spam folder. Yep, there‚Äôs the rejection, saying that I should ignore my nationality and instead use my country of residence. That‚Äôs annoying and two days wasted...

So, I submit different docs and get confirmation within a few minutes. Awesome! I generate a BTC deposit address and send over a small amount for testing. Ten minutes later, I get a notification of the pending deposit, saying the amount will be available once there are two confirmations - pretty standard. Well, there are now four confirmations and my deposit is still pending. For reference, a transaction I sent after this on CoinSwap has already been deposited, which means two separate series of confirmations have completed.

While some of their features are promising, their UI is misleading and backend functionality isn‚Äôt working as advertised. Hopefully I‚Äôll be able to update this review with better news soon.

Update: it‚Äôs now been over an hour and a half with eight confirmations - and my transaction is still pending.

I would really enjoy an automated investment program that E*TRADE has and vanguard, making the management costs down and just a place to put investment without worrying of buying and selling. Would be good for those who don‚Äôt want to actively manage their portfolio. Also would help in taking irrational decisions making out of the equation. I would like an option for a algorithm that does the management process for me for a portion of my portfolio. So if I got ill, sick, or died, it would be easy to transfer into that option‚Ä¶",4,app_store,en,0.17163059163059166,0.9933

But that has more to do with me than the app. The app however has always been free, was the first to be free, and changed modern trading. I‚Äôve never run into the issues that some people say Robinhood has had. My money is deposited in 3-5 business days. I can enter limit orders. I can trade basically how I want. Over the years they‚Äôve had a few updates like showing total percent change, not just daily. I like the line graph that shows total change in nomal dollars over time. I‚Äôve used some crypto apps that just show your dialy % change only, and its nice to see how far you‚Äôve come along without having to go back to your excel/googlesheet spreadsheet. I‚Äôve learned from those newbie mistakes over the years, and I regularly add to my portfolio and I am usually seeing my money move up and to the right. Dividends come in when they are supposed to. I haven‚Äôt seen any real issues to be honest. 

The only thing Robinhood needs to do now is allow IRA accounts, and Roth, and not just personal taxable accounts. They should really open up to be a new Vanguard and then they‚Äôd really take over the world. But for the time being, it‚Äôs a great way to learn about the stock market, and it looks really sharp, and I would recommend it as app number 1 for anyone who wants to get into stocks.

I very much enjoy the margin account under Gold (well done and conditions are fair) and I see how Robinhood is constantly improving it. However, definitely problematic are the following aspects: 1. Power usage, the app is draining my battery. Idk if it is because I have a lot of stocks on the watch list and every time I open the app it‚Äôs loading in all data for each of them or something, no idea. But my phone gets very warm after a few minutes of using the app (iPhone Xs with 96% battery health and iOS 13.6). 2. Technical issues at order placing. Low volume products such as certain options or even for high volume blue chip stocks sometimes the order confirmation page is loading for 5min before it‚Äôs placed. Same thing for cancelling an existing order sometimes. Usually though this isn‚Äôt much of an issue. 3. Robinhood has the ‚Äúreplace order‚Äù button for placed but pending orders for options. Why not also make it a button for placed but pending stock orders? Would be so convenient. 4. I just wish you‚Äôd see some more data next to the list where you see PE and yields. Beta coefficient and payout ratio would be absolutely lovely to have there. Important metrics and convenient to see at one glance.

To start with, commission free trading allows you to make (practically) unlimited tweaks/optimizations to your holdings, and to react quickly (as fast as humanly possible - computers are obviously faster) to changes in the market. Real-time alerts and market analysis gives you important up-to-date information to inform these decisions. The month of free Gold Member status (currently need to enable this manually), which comes with instant deposits, is a great way to fund your account and start building your portfolio quickly (I haven‚Äôt tried transferring money out as yet, but this will likely take 5 business days). The phone app is very user-friendly, making various types of trades simple and convenient. The only bad thing is that trading in Robinhood is ADDICTIVE, and don‚Äôt be surprised if you want to spend several hours per day (or night, with cryptocurrencies) trying to optimize your gains. Some suggestions for improvement include (1) access to other types of cryptocurrencies and the ability to do more complex trades beyond just market or limit orders, (2) the ability to ‚Äòshift‚Äô the time range being displayed on market data plots (e.g. to center a 1 week display range to be centered a few days/weeks in the past), (3) the ability to do more advanced analysis of market data by superimposing trend lines/curves.",5,app_store,en,0.11839080459770117,0.9824

To that I say I‚Äôm sure that happens, but Robinhood does their part to prevent this. They have educational resources and built in info and messages to caution and inform about risky trading actions. Do not blame Robinhood for the thoughtlessness of careless users. Having access to the tools Robinhood provides is truly freeing and empowering. Yes, they have their bugs and other issues. However, the platform is so preferable to any other platform that I am not bothered at all by an occasional downtime or other issue.

If you do nothing else, at the very least get their robinhood debit card and use it for all your drive-thru food and beverage orders. There is absolutely no other investment service that will give you as much of a bonus as the Robinhood round-up rewards program. Personally, I set my roundup rewards to give me Tesla stock, but if you want full exposure to the national average, find an S&P500 ETF and watch your spare change compound over time.

I personally love robinhood gold‚Äôs competitive interest rates, but margin is rather complicated for beginners, so proceed with caution. That being said, if you plan to dollar cost average into the markets on a daily basis, Robinhood‚Äôs margin makes this incredibly easy while opening up your personal income to pay down your higher rate loans. It‚Äôs a no brainer. If you only so much as use the first $1,000 of robinhood gold, you get an APY of ~6% which blows all credit card rates out of the water. Get margin, dollar cost average at the rate you pay off your credit cards, and profit the difference. 

Disclaimer: You need at least $2,000+ to gain access to margin, hence this is not a tactic for low income earners.

However for Robinhood to flourish they need to incorporate WAY more crypto assets and offer a much better variety of options in this class as it is the future and they are losing out to other platforms. Also other platforms offer staking options, retirement account options, and options trading. These are big deals in investing and it is losing Robinhood a lot of business to other platforms that offer these services.

I personally have lost out on good buys due to the slow transaction times for funds, and not everyone wants to or should have to pay extra to have more funds clear quickly.

That is when did each analyst rating actually happen. 30 could have been before a big news break and perhaps only 7 after. Making for a possibly inaccurate rating.

The other thing I believe can be improved is the amount of time that it takes for your application to be approved, I know that this can be challenging since many people are applying but the market changes at moments and you loose the chances of buying stocks at a lower price by the time your application is approved.

The entire process is very polished and made trading/research enjoyable while providing the needed information. I have no complaints whatsoever with the program from a technical standpoint.

Had you solicited my opinion prior to the end of January, I would have given an equally glowing review for the trading ethics as well. Being that the process of making a trade is rather simple, one can only say that Robinhood provided the service as expected or did not. As I‚Äôm sure Robinhood is well aware, trading was restricted on a number of shares due to ‚Äúvolatility‚Äù as your messages called it. Later, an explanation was provided that the clearinghouse would not approve trades in certain equities due to this volatility. As a service which provides access to the stock market via commission free trading, Robinhood and its clearinghouse should have been aware of such volatility‚Äôs prior to the events that unfolded. Instead, it‚Äôs users were denied an opportunity that many have acknowledged may never happen again.

In short, Robinhood employs a streamlined and user-friendly means of interacting with the stock market. However, this comes at a price: such access can be denied whenever Robinhood is unprepared to deal with foreseeable issues. It leaves this user to wonder whether there aren‚Äôt more reliable platforms that may not look as nice.",3,app_store,en,0.16257142857142856,0.9035

One suggestion I do have is when I‚Äôm looking at the line graph of a stock that I have shares in, I‚Äôd like to be able to see visually on the graph where I jumped in at. So say I bought some shares at $4.67/share and I held the shares for 2 months. If I click on the 3 month view of that stock, I‚Äôd like to see a little pin or something on the date that I bought my shares at. That way I can see in an instant whether I bought while the price was high or low or mid. Also it helps just in general to see what spikes I‚Äôve held my shares through and which dips I‚Äôve been along for the ride for. I could see this being particularly helpful in situations where I‚Äôm buying/selling a lot of shares quickly, or I‚Äôm trying to study the markets and look at my past investments. We would be able to notice patterns in our trading habits like if we are overly aggressive on a regular basis, or if we are consistently too passive. I‚Äôve noticed just by my own tracking that I tend to sell a little early. But if I were trading on much larger scales with a lot more money, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to mentally keep track of everything.

I‚Äôm mainly interested in long-term investments, but the few short term trades that I‚Äôve made have been a breeze.

All of my funds (majority of my savings...) in the meantime are completely locked up, unable to trade and invest or be transferred back to my bank. I have submitted all sorts of documents, such as identification and legal documentation. However, over the weeks, rather than being able to speak with an actual human being, all I have received are scripted and automated responses. Robinhood doesn‚Äôt have an actual phone number to call (which seems very problematic for a financial institution) and relies on what appears to be an automated system to submit responses, in which your replies will never be read and your issues never actually resolved. 

I am incredibly upset right now, Robinhood has majority of my savings currently locked up in their account without giving me any means of being able to get in touch with an actual human being to be able to get things resolved in a timely manner and it is making me very anxious and very upset.

326,robinhood-investing-for-all,Phone Philmmaker,2021-03-02 04:12:17,"Robinhood is a great way to start investing cash in stocks with fractional shares, which generally start at a dollar.  It doesn‚Äôt have to be your life savings, it can just be like $20 here and there.  Rather than having the money sit around, it can grow with the market, and appreciate in value generally faster than the interest from your bank or whatever.  It‚Äôs not a game, you could lose real money, so be careful.  FTC rules dictate that you can‚Äôt do risky moves like day-trading if you don‚Äôt have tens of thousands to play with, but that‚Äôs probably for the best.
There‚Äôs some weirdness around wait times for bank transfers and some controversy around whether you really get the full value of what you buy, due to the financial mechanisms they use to make trades ‚Äúfree‚Äù - but that‚Äôs to be expected for financial services like this.
The app is nicely designed but a little buggy - sometimes it loses track of what‚Äôs in your lists and what isn‚Äôt, for example.  When trading crypto it‚Äôs not as fast or as granular as a real exchange. It has a news feature which is pretty informative.  
All in all, if investing is something you have been wanting to try, I would recommend giving it a shot through Robinhood.  It‚Äôs fun!  Just be careful and smart about it.  Like gambling, don‚Äôt wager what you can‚Äôt afford to lose.",4,app_store,en,0.1815993788819876,0.991

Trying to figure out how to make money for my family since I had my first baby coming in 2021. Kept seeing the Doctors  and Nurses talk trades and thought I could attempt. I like talking business and learning where the future is going. Got onto the app store picking through apps that offer trades and Robinhood popped right up. Since I love the name Robinhood because of plenty of funny movies yet the idea of wealth spread out it was a no brainer for me. RH has made it friendly learning with plenty of help for a person as slow as me to understand and make my first trades. Very exciting days learning to follow companies and hear what others say using social medias to follow have helped me a lot. If you are brand new to investing, look at Robinhood and even if you are an investor of many years it is still helpful to use with other platforms. Thankful to Robinhood and Jim Cramer for getting me through mu first months of learning about markets. They both go hand in hand for me.

They‚Äôve targeted a niche area of the market which caused a domino effect for the rest of the brokers. Robinhood moves other brokers away from fees per trade and change the game for good. However with that they provide an extremely good UI which is simplistic and easy to use. This is especially good for newer traders and investors as well as it making it a pleasant and seamless experience. But with that being said there are few bugs that they need to work one. Starting with the accuracy of the charts of portfolios. I‚Äôve noticed and a few friends of mine have noticed a few offages (Money I put in + growth) doesn‚Äôt always add up.

RobinHood has and is solving a market problem by offering an investment solution for the masses, highlighting the fact that investors should understand what they are doing and what they are investing in.

I know the price you submit your request at is not guaranteed, but the fluctuation is far too few in between to be the reason why my sale price was so far off of my ticket submission price (there‚Äôs only 1 second in between these two things). Started to look into it and yeah, it‚Äôs pretty fishy. If you are profiting at a small amount, they lead you to believe you gained money by using psychological tricks (colors of the chart and the positive earnings calculations), but if you actually look at what gets put into your money that can go back into your pocket, there‚Äôs some money missing. It‚Äôs not a crazy chunk but I have lost a couple hundred where they have led me to believe I‚Äôm profiting just above the breaking even point. And if you think about it, when they do it to thousands of people, they are reallly profiting off of it. Such a bummer because it‚Äôs so dishonest.

But since they‚Äôre a few coins that have gained popularity in the app such as DOGE, it would best to see if they may want to add a few more alt coins in there that are trending in popularity or traction that can be bought or sold in order to have additional income progressing as some alt coins have done so and currently still do so.

I loved Robinhood at first because it was a great was for me to dip into the stock market without feeling overwhelmed by the big bad ‚Äústock market‚Äù. It is very user friendly and the support team did respond to me fairly quickly...HOWEVER. When any ‚Äúfree market‚Äù company like Robinhood limit the amount of shares on can purchase it manipulates the price of a stock. If a Hedge fund can have a transaction worth millions of dollars at a time one way ‚Äúshort‚Äù and retail investors can only have transactions of say $1000 at the same time. It doesn‚Äôt take a Wall Street expert to figure out that the price of the stock is going to drop based on those two transactions. Ultimately costing the $1000 to lose money and the millions turning billions. These are both hypothetical numbers because I could only purchase 1 stock today worth about $250. Robinhood even went as far as to cancel my original stock purchase with the reason ‚Äúyou canceled you stock purchase‚Äù. I did no such thing. By the time they got back to my the stock had gone up by a few dollars costing me more money for the same share amount. Every single email or alert stating a reason is all blatant lies and causes more outrage. Yes it is a private company. Yes the disclaimer allows them to do what they did. They are just doing it in plain site. Would definitely not recommend at all.,1,app_store,en,0.12297619047619045,0.9472

Although I don‚Äôt understand the pattern trading/ day trading restrictions. I have started trading options and i need to be able to buy and sell quickly. Such as I was up 25 percent on a options and couldn‚Äôt sell it due to having other day trading warnings before i get to number 4 and then get my account restricted. Although through research i have found out you only need 25K in your account to bypass this. Which for a small trading account such as my self it‚Äôs hard to get 25K (When i say small say trader i mean an account under 1K) So i was just wondering if there was anyway i could go about getting this removed but still being able to day trade. 

Edit: I have also now seen that if you turn off instant deposits you can also say trade but that then restricts me from reinvesting me profits from the last trade which at least to me is very important because i am a very small trading account. If there is anyway you could help me so i can day trade without 25K in my account or turning off insistent deposits then that would be great.",5,app_store,en,0.06844202898550725,0.9518

I got a new phone number. To log into robinhood, I had to do a 2 step verification with the old phone number I had. Since I didn‚Äôt have that phone anymore I couldn‚Äôt do this so I went along with Robinhood‚Äôs support to change my phone number within the app so I can access my assets. When I was talking with their support, it took forever to get a response, and I kept getting the same response which makes me think I was just talking to a robot. They would ask for my SS number, pictures of my driver‚Äôs license, picture of the SS card, etc. I was happy to provide all the information necessary because I just wanted access to my account. They then asked for a pdf of my last bank statement with my bank account number in it. I talked with my bank and they said they don‚Äôt provide bank statements with the account number, but with my member number. So I told the Robinhood support this info and they LOCKED my account. I was even able to provide everything about my bank account but simply couldn‚Äôt do that because it was impossible and Robinhood wasn‚Äôt understanding whatsoever. To make things much worse, I receive emails a few days later for each stock I owned being sold (over $1000 worth). I have no access to my account so it is impossible for me to do this.

1) Robinhood sells your options an hour before the market closes, let‚Äôs say you have an option contract worth 50$ at 2:00 P.M. and you chose to wait till 3:00, Robinhood sells it for lower than market price ( it doesn‚Äôt market sell )
2) what happened with Reddit stocks can happen with any stock on a volatile day, however it didn‚Äôt happen with KODK, let‚Äôs say the volatility was too high with GME, Robinhood is still unprepared for future events. To understand this better if everyone at Reddit chose AAPL instead, Robinhood would‚Äôve still done the same as it doesn‚Äôt have enough money to clear the sales, which again brings back false advertising 
3) people committed suicide cuz of Robinhood‚Äôs exploitation of amateur traders by lucrative margin offers and stupidly ridiculous user interface which is claimed to be user friendly however in stock market you need informative interface over bright colors that make it seem like a game 
4) options are going to ruin the stock market due the bubble they create, Robinhood made this worse by approving amateur traders to trade options, for example I convinced my friend to create an account in Robinhood with a portfolio value of 300$ and 2 days later he got his options enabled, same guy who banks with chase and had an investment account with them for over a month with 2000$ in portfolio value got denied.",1,app_store,en,-0.010797101449275365,0.7876

The one thing I did was start a 401k and contributed to that every pay period (as a straight deduction because I was not disciplined enough to do it on my own). I told my coworker to send me the link to the app, and I would join. It was sent to me, and I sat on it for a year. Finally, I decided to join. It has been a rough ride.

So many times I thought I was being screwed, but when I would explain what I wasn‚Äôt happy about, the CSRs would explain the situation, and almost every time it was because I failed to read something I should have.

At first, the app seemed fine and I liked that they didn‚Äôt charge fees, and liked how easy it was to execute trades with a swipe. Over time, robinhood has gone down hill. Firstly, they do charge fees. They post it at the bottom of every trade labeled as ‚Äúregulatory fee‚Äù. Secondly, i noticed that if you execute your sales at market price, robinhood charges you the highest possible price between the bid and ask spread, as well as buys it at the lowest price between that spread. Thats not truly the market value that is posted at any given moment, because many times i have sold shares of a stock and even though the stock never dropped in price during the sale my shares were still sold for lower. Does robinhood keep the difference? Whats up with that? This also defeats the purpose of their ‚Äúease‚Äù if i have to set a limit order every time i want to buy and sell at ‚Äúmarket value‚Äù. So their claims of no fees are wrong, and their ease of use isnt so easy. What benefit do i have trading with them?

I feel users have become bored and frustrated with Robinhood because of seemingly empty promises that go on for extraordinarily long periods of time. And it pushes the majority to find new places to do their trading. Also, the idea of adding more cryptocurrencies and wallets has been anticipated for some time now. And although Robinhood reiterated that they are being thorough with security measures before making changes there are plenty of other platforms that have them beat.

1. Robinhood does not give you best execution. That means that if they can execute your limit order at a better price than what you specified then rather than give you the extra money, they will pocket the difference. 
2. Robinhood is bad at options trading. If you are doing spreads they sometimes don‚Äôt recognize that you are trying to do. For example if you sell a put with a $40 strike price and you buy a put at a $30 strike price, you are doing that to cover yourself in case the stock takes a dramatic plunge. However if the stock drops to $20 and you are assigned on your $40 put it will assign you those shares rather that excercising the $30 put simultaneously so that you are only out $10. 
3. They control what stocks you can trade. They are democratizing investing, but only when they like your investment. A few weeks ago they shut down trading on Game Stop and the few other popular tickets which hurt retail investors efforts to trigger a short squeeze. Robinhood claimed to be doing this because they did not have the capital requirements for their broker and there is truth to that. However the leadership was not transparent about this while it was happening. And even so, if they are set up so that their brokerages control them, then maybe we should use a brokerage that gives us more freedom.",1,app_store,en,0.03523391812865497,-0.2433

Firstly there are many many more cryptocurrency‚Äôs than you support. One of the draws to apps like Coinbase is that they support 6-7 times more so it‚Äôs easier to diversify there.

Secondly the amount of time it takes to move money from your app to a bank is honestly atrocious. If you can take the money out of banks same day you should at least be able to move money back next day. Thirdly just the collusion between the apps owners and Wall Street. There should be complete separation. You are not a neutral third party and it was blatantly shown with the GameStop meme shutdown.

Takes multiple days 5 or more after you sell some stock! Before you are eligible to even transfer it back to your banking account ! Then another process of waiting days for it to clear in your account ! Not only that they only let to transfer a portion of YOUR money out of the Robinhood account! Several times I would send the link to someone I was referring so I could get the free stock ! Well It would send me the link I sent to the referred person and their link back to them! Another words they couldn‚Äôt use the link you sent em! And if they don‚Äôt sign up through the link you sent you don‚Äôt get your free stock! It‚Äôs a little shady to say the least!

1. No beneficiary option. Why in the word wouldn‚Äôt you have a section where I can name my spouse or kids as the owner of my investments if something should happen to me. Instead they‚Äôre not offering the option and directing people to basically fight for your stuff in court. So I can tell you right now if that option isn‚Äôt added in a few months I‚Äôm guaranteed to leave Robinhood.
2. The information on stocks is often inaccurate, for example I‚Äôm big on dividend stocks and very often I would go check a stock that I absolutely know pays a good dividend and Robinhood will have the Div/yield section listed as Nothing. So then I have to double check with webull or nasdaq to get the truth.. this is a big issue and can really cause someone to make decisions.

These can be even further broken down by just clicking on the individual investment. The only reason I gave Robinhood 4 stars instead of 5 is because 1) I wish there was an instant deposit to bank option after you sell a stock and 2) Robinhood is so user-friendly that I would expect to see a separate number telling you your total exact profit separately from the number at the top that says how much you‚Äôre investing total.

The first thing is that they consider instant deposit to be margin...want a cash account to avoid PDT rules? Get ready to wait.  It took almost 3 weeks of dealing with customer service to accomplish it, then once done watch how transfers are handled - money leaves your bank overnight and gets settled in your account in 5 to 7 days.

I‚Äôve been using Robinhood for over two years now. 1st I want to say the platform is brilliant, and the commission free promise revolutionized the online broker industry. However, in the last few months I‚Äôve explored some other brokers and I‚Äôve noticed some HUGE drawbacks when comparing robinhood to other platforms. My biggest complaint is the fact that I can‚Äôt name a beneficiary for my portfolio. 2nd is the computer interface. Love the phone app but the Robinhood website on computer is so far behind every other broker that I‚Äôve decided to move most of my assets to other brokers. 3rd is the charts offered by Robinhood. They‚Äôve hardly changed since I started years ago and are falling behind when compared to other platforms. I will say, the addition of partial shares and dividend reinvestment was a huge step for Robinhood and I can‚Äôt wait to see what other advances are made in the future. If some changes are made and RH allows me to name a beneficiary I will definitely come back to the platform, but for now I‚Äôm transferring nearly everything to my other brokers.

Not one warning came through that it was almost time to sell and I have to say this is very poor development and I believe intentional. The notifications are late, if you are in the app watching the data lags and is seriously behind. One view shows one value and selecting the stock you are watching an entirely different. This app does not deserve 1 star. It is laggy, customer service directs you to the help page and when you finally get a message and correct the bull that you are being told you NEVER hear from customer service again. So if you have money you want taken from you unfairly then sure download app. Believe EVERY bad review because it is absolutely true.

To the developer who is answering mine and all other bad reviews with SAME response ...you have zero and I repeat zero desire to correct ANY of these complaints.

For those of you who don‚Äôt understand what has been happening, a whole lot of average people noticed how much the hedge fund guys were to make off of shorting. With no regard to who is on the losing side. So those ordinary people decided to put all their faith in GameStop and AMC to drive the price UP, so these greedy elite ended up losing billions. Whose side is Robinhood on? Theirs. They violated our rights, prevented free trade and put every obstacle In the way to make sure the public LOST money so that the elite could stop bleeding money. 

I had been buying AMC stock steadily since it tanked just under $2. I didn‚Äôt even know what was happening yet when I tried to buy another 100 shares. My buy was REJECTED (for no reason and hence illegal). AMC peaked around $25 a share the next day. They wouldn‚Äôt allow anyone to buy because if the price drove up that far, THE BILLIONAIRES WOULD LOSE MONEY. So they cost me $2500 that I very much could have used. I am an average person with a family and work three jobs. So *#!!@! Robinhood and ‚Äú&$!@ Google for defending them.

One BIG issue I would like to see updated is when selling stocks I noticed that it appears to be stocks that are last in- first out when being sold... Is it possible to choose which stocks to sell? For example, if I purchase stock in BAC in January 2020, hold it for until January 2021 for tax purposes, then sell it could I specifically target which shares I choose to sell? I have noticed if I buy BAC in January then buy more in March then go to sell the first batch of shares in January the app defaults to the shares I bought in March. I mention this because many times an investor buys shares in a company they like and then the price drops so they buy more, but over time if the price rises and even goes above the original purchase price it would be more convenient to sell the original shares and hold onto the more recently purchased shares for tax purposes. Hope this is not too confusing. I would be happy to clarify and always appreciate the Robinhood team‚Äôs approach towards asking it‚Äôs customers for feedback!!!

I love the KuCoin application, it‚Äôs fast and the user interface is easy to learn and navigate.

This is a major turn off, there‚Äôs no reason for KuCoin to ask permissions to my photo album for me to buy crypto. I bypass this by going on their website using a PC, but it‚Äôs massively inconvenient.

One can easily look up a coin or token and check its current price and daily gain/loss percentage. On the other hand, this has 3 stars because there are many apps like this, that even allow people to do more. With this said, a few things should be considered.

1. Being able to set alerts for cryptos on your watchlist, so if say Adshares surpasses 50¬¢ it will send a notification. Or if a coin on a watchlist has dropped or gained a certain percentage.

2. Add a widget. So certain coins or tokens on a watchlist could be easily looked at from the iPhone home screen, like CoinBase‚Äôs widget.

3. Donation option through the app via crypto, PayPal, or IAP. Maybe even purchasing something that gets rid of the small banner ad at the bottom of the app.

4. Looking at social media/reddit posts about the crypto through an embedded WebKit. You already have something sort of like this on your website. Just allow users to go to a ‚Äúsocial media view‚Äù or something where they can see updates from the crypto company or about the crypto.

You changed it to require the user to tap the ‚Äòlast‚Äô button over and over to get the current price. The Bid/Ask/Last no longer continuously update.

To begin with Webull is by far the best trading app and their interface is stunning. 
You also can pay for extra perks to gain for more data exposure for the user which is why I love Webull. I had contacted customer service via phone and or through their online help. Calling I have received exceptional support as for the help support chat messages on the App need a little more TLC. Besides that any issues I have run across like a bug or glitch it was taken care of same day. The community aspect of the app is great, they have plenty of professional traders assisting new comers. The one thing they need to work on is getting rid of spam bots and duplicate fake accounts, warning for new users do not take direct advice from anyone on the platform, find out who exactly your seeing a watchlist from or advice from. Don‚Äôt jump aboard a stock just because, another account says ‚Äúit‚Äôs gonna explode‚Äùwith a horrible chart or non at all. I would start doing their paper trading and they also have paper trading competitions you can join prior to going live and spending your hard earned money. Always trade smart, have a passion for learning more, and the road to financial freedom doesn‚Äôt come easy.

Webull takes ridiculously long to deposit money and you won‚Äôt have instant deposits right away. Once you buy a stock with instant deposits you can‚Äôt sell for at least three days so forget day trading with instant deposits. You can forget trading options with instant deposits too and the options quotes page is awful to look at and the Greeks are different than other brokers. It takes forever for money to settle after I sell a stock and the costumer service takes forever to respond to anything. I also don‚Äôt like how the piece won‚Äôt update after the market closes so I can‚Äôt see after hours trading.

If you are on rh and are thinking about trying Webull don‚Äôt do it cause you will be disappointed. I really don‚Äôt understand how some people love Webull so much.

So far, I‚Äôve been loving the service and functionality, and the app itself runs super smoothly on my iPhone, but on my iPad it still won‚Äôt let me rotate the app to landscape which is super annoying. Only watch lists are viewable in Landscpae on iPad. I would love to be able to access all areas of the app in landscape on iPad especially trading. It would be excellent if this could be fixed in the future. Also if we could be able to see which stocks support short selling without having to be told after setting up an order, that would be most helpful. It is super annoying to have a very precise short order all set up and then when it is time to submit the order it says the stock isn‚Äôt supported. Very annoying. Even a small emblem next to the ticker would suffice. 

 But overall this is a to notch app, and coming from Robinhood I‚Äôm definitely not going back. This app is way better for the active trader than Robinhood.

Some notes:
1) One of my biggest concerns is lack of transparency.  Well more recently I feel that customer service has been more open and responsive especially with issues that are not directly related to Webull (e.g. any issues with Apex clearing).  I mentioned earlier about lack of acknowledgment on ties to Fumi, but in a recent interview - on Benzinga - I found the CEO was as transparent as he potentially can be.  Yet, I do think some further transparency overall, with eventually its own self-clearing would make me very confident in Webull overall to maybe put a larger part of my portfolio with them (currently I have 25% with them).
2) My other big concern was stability of non-mobile platforms, which with the newest iPad and desktop 4.8 updates are getting better, but still need some further work.  4.8 especially seems to be missing some features which the earlier desktop version and web version have, so I can‚Äôt wait to see how desktop 4 develops over the next few months to include all of the great features.",4,app_store,en,0.1046296296296296,0.927

Webull Developers, can we PLEASE implement the hot keys to be saved no matter which desktop/computer you‚Äôre on?

The amount of data you have access too is amazing. Great traders make great gains because they do their DD and Webull provides a ton of data points for you to do your analysis. Not only is the app great I love using the Desktop version as you can set up your boards for multiples trade widgets on one screen for multiple orders on different plays. 

The only thing I would have to say they lack in is speed when it comes to settling or clearing your money for purchases. There have been multiple instances where I have not been able purchase options as my cash had not completely settled from trades I made earlier in the week. Even putting more money into your account can not side step this as they do not allow you to purchase option on instant buying power either so you would still have to wait for your deposit to settle before using it. That was the explanation I received from their support. 

One way around this, I have started is making sure I have any money I want to use for next week deposited or having a portion of your portfolio start the settling process a week prior to when you want to trade to make sure it is available for you.

2. Able to add WeBull account to my Quicken or Quickbooks. If it‚Äôs a bank account must be able to add to a personal finance tracking. This is a big one should have listed it first.

5. WeBull should always work in making the app better so that new subscribers keep coming. Not like some apps that look really have not been updated and look like the 1980s..

This is unacceptable when it lies on the behalf of apex to sort this problem out. I also have been blocked by trading on the app even after my deposits have cleared. To make it even worse i only did this because i saw the deposit $100 or more and you'll get an additional 5 free stocks. This is nothing but a sham that they use to make you give them money because i deposited $200+ and nothing. I have had an account at Merrill Lynch for 2 years now and i have never had a problem with money transfer. Dont use this absolute joke of an app that tells that you cant trade a stock and not give a reason other than its not supported even though it is on other platforms.,1,app_store,en,0.014285714285714287,-0.9766

I‚Äôd rather pay commission sometimes for best execution. I will say though, they have Robinhood beat on execution and pretty much everything else too. However... 

They lost me money on Kodak pump because my stop loss order didn‚Äôt trigger during a halt so I was forced to cancel the stop loss and market sell which was a 7k difference. It was unresolved and i had to bite it. So better than any brokerage app out there as far as features, but still have trust issues in regards to order execution.

The other really big drawback is that fund transfers from external bank accounts don‚Äôt actually settle for 5 days. That is definitely much longer than the others I have used in the past.

1. Webull only supports a FIFO execution on your stocks, which is the stocks brought first is sold first. So if I have to sell last brought as first to save on taxes where in one instance doing FIFO would cost me to pay tax $1400 whereas LIFO would cost mere $100. 

2. Entered an long call option anticipating that I could sell a short call option later or once brought. I was taken back surprise as they do not support it. While every other brokerage supports this. I do not want to blame Webull for this for running into losses, but you‚Äôre left with not much choices

3. There is no way you can place an order during your night time say after arker hours for both options as well as stocks. If you are putting up an order for something, it has to be done during market or atleast post market hours but not during night time

If you want to keep these hassles away, try different brokerages. Almost everyone provides free trades except .65 cents on options. But given these hassles where you pay more taxes because of they wierd FIFO mechanism, I can guarantee that other brokerages saves me on such things.

I have only used a few other trading apps and this one by far has the best charting ability. On the downside the app gets bogged down by all the features and trades get timed out and the app freezes. It‚Äôs like we bull needs two apps one for strict trading and another for speculating and research. I‚Äôm learning the day trading side so timing is everything but also learned that I needed a margin account and we bull provides a great starting entry point unlike other trading platforms. That whole thing with getting frame freeze might be the deal killer though. It could be that webull turns out to be a great place to get started until you get the min start up for other margin accounts. I do love it so far.,4,app_store,en,0.21417548500881836,0.9612

2. With the last update, you can no longer make the app default to an individual account on the main screen. It defaults to the all account view no matter if you reinstall or try other options.

1. When you use ethereum to buy an altcoin and then you make money on the altcoin and then sell to ethereum the app counts that as you 'buying' ethereum and then adds this to your Net Cost. But this has already been added to your net cost when you bought the ether, so it's not really accurate in that sense. Also the net cost should go down based on how much ether you gained on the sale of the altcoin.

2. When you take profits on your portfolio the overall graph of your portfolio earnings shows that you lost money simply because the overall number is lower, but in reality you just cashed out to dollars and your portfolio has actually done better.

Fees - The app doesn‚Äôt tell you how much in fees it‚Äôs taking out at the time you buy or sell, which makes tracking difficult. I end up having to lose money at buy and sell at a higher price than I thought.

Transaction & Profit/Loss - It doesn‚Äôt track my transactions when I buy them. So I have to buy them, plug the numbers in, and guess the fee I paid so that I can try to make up for that loss. Profit & Loss is high dependent on the interaction.

Price Lag - the prices on the app are different than other app or sites. Why is there no real-time data?

No limit orders - again, makes buying really tough because you can‚Äôt guarantee the price before you buy it. If you‚Äôre trading crypto, well, limit orders are kind of a necessary.

Charts - I would like for the investment tab to show me how much money I have gained or lost over a user defined period of time. Sometimes I don‚Äôt care about the last 24 hrs. Maybe I  need to default to a few hours or a few months. It helps when trying to not lose money.

However, I often find the mobile app more of a nuisance to use than I should, and it really only works out well if your using it for entering orders and using the desktop site to watch the chart, because you absolutely can not do both feasibly, especially in fast-moving, high volume situations. For one the trade history ticker gets covered up by the clunky and overly large buy/sell pop up. The app also doesnt support scrubbing back and forth in time divisions. You are limited to a fixed window of the last 35 periods of time in each division. Lastly, this app devours battery charge. It is evident something highly resource consuming is going on during runtime in this app, possibly constantly polling the site for updates to the chart? My phone has gotten pretty hot from leaving this app on screen for extended amounts of time. This doesn‚Äôt happen outside of coinbase pro.

- FDIC insurance on your stored USD currency (not on BTC though Coinbase itself is established enough to personally insure, though this is only as good as their word).

- Instant trading capabilities upon USD deposit

- High enough global trading volume to fulfill the average person‚Äôs limit-sell orders completely 

Cons:

- Both the website app and website terminal itself leaves much to desired, namely:

- Can‚Äôt view the chart, trading terminal, and all orders in one screen.

- On the app, you can‚Äôt view exactly how much USD you have to trade with (for example yesterday said I had $1,500 USD balance available after a few of my trades cleared but that was 0.02xx BTC in my wallet, not the actual USD amount.

- Chart has few overlay options and you can‚Äôt view your orders on the chart like with Binance, which at this point should be a required feature on any crypto platform

- Both the app and website terminal are slower than any other existing exchange.

Overall:  I like Coinbase itself and will continue using it since I have a high 30-day trading volume and thus the fees are low for me, and the security is probably the best out of any exchange.
